The data group has created a copy of the Master dataset sent by the city. It is in an Excel document, Data Group Traffic Spreadsheet.xlsx,  with multiple sheets.  The sheets labeled "PM 2016 (MASTER)" and "Intersection ID" are the original data sent from the city. The "PM 2016 (MASTER) has 27780 lines with an overview of all the network settings and five different types of data sets for each intersection. The "Intersection ID" is a one-to-one matching of the intersection ID with the road names.

To facilitate access and understanding of the data, we have also created separate sheets for the six different sets of intersection data: Network Settings, Node Data, Link Data, Lane Data, Timing Plan Settings, Phasing Data.
